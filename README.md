# INTRODUCTION

Rainfall prediction remains a serious concern and has attracted the attention of governments, industries, risk management entities, as well as the scientific community. Rainfall is a climatic factor that affects many human activities like agricultural production, construction, power generation, forestry and tourism, among others. To this extent, rainfall prediction is essential since this variable is the one with the highest correlation with adverse natural events such as landslides, flooding, mass movements and avalanches. These incidents have affected society for years. Therefore, having an appropriate approach for rainfall prediction makes it possible to take preventive and mitigation measures for these natural phenomena .  To solve this uncertainty, we used various machine learning techniques and models to make accurate and timely predictions. These paper aims to provide end to end machine learning life cycle right from Data preprocessing to implementing models to evaluating them. Data Preprocessing steps include imputing missing values, feature transformation, encoding categorical features, feature scaling and feature selection. We implemented models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbour, Rule-based and Ensembles. For evaluation purpose, we used Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Score and Area Under Curve as evaluation metrics. For our experiments, we train our classifiers using Australian weather data gathered from various weather stations in Australia.Rainfall prediction is one of the challenging and uncertain tasks which has a significant impact on human society. Timely and accurate predictions can help to proactively reduce human and financial loss. This study presents a set of experiments which involve the use of prevalent machine learning techniques to build models to predict whether it is going to rain tomorrow or not based on weather data for that particular day in major cities of Australia. This comparative study is conducted concentrating on three aspects: modeling inputs, modeling methods, and pre-processing techniques. The results provide a comparison of various evaluation metrics of these machine learning techniques and their reliability to predict the rainfall by analyzing the weather data. Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting, KNN, Decision Tree, Adaboost Classifier, and Catboost Classifier are the algorithms used to make the predictions.
